1. Autofill when you pause the video
2. Make video float so it can always be seen in the add video page
3. Could try to make video confirmation better by finding out why nothing after addVideoData runs
4. While the checkbox is checked, below it should show the checkboxes auto populated with the segments of the video
5. Fix reading chapters so it can read chapters from videos without timestamps in the description
6. Make the remove segment remove the specific segment
