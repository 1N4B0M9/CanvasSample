1. Reverse order of segmentations
2. Autofill when you pause the video
3. Make video float so it can always be seen in the add video page
4. Could try to make video confirmation better by finding out why nothing after addVideoData runs
5. Make add segment be at the top
6. While the checkbox is checked, below it should show the checkboxes auto populated with the segments of the video
7. Fix reading chapters so it can read chapters from videos without timestamps in the description
9.
