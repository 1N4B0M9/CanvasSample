- [ ] Get rid of moment???


1. Autofill section time when you pause the video
2. Fix the video float so that it wont overlap when the page size is shrinked or just come up with a new way to make the video float
3. Could try to make video confirmation better by finding out why nothing after addVideoData runs
4. While the checkbox is checked, below it should show the segments auto populated with the stop times of the video gotten from the description from the youtube api
5. Fix reading chapters so it can read chapters from videos without timestamps in the description (after some research this seems impossible with the youtube api)
6. Make the remove segment remove the specific segment (right now it is removing the first one always i think)
7. Possibly create a list of bugs/solving bugs that have to do with the Add Videos feature.
